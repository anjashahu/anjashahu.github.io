My research revolves primarily around causal inference with applications related to environmental health and mental health. My current research project focuses on developing methods for conducting causal inference of rates of change in longitudinal settings that have complications, such as complex missingness and irregular assessment times.\n\n\n\nEducation\nPhD in Biostatistics\nColumbia University\nGraduation: May 2027 (Expected)\nMS in Biostatistics\nHarvard University\nGraduation: May 2022\nBA in Public Health Studies\nJohns Hopkins University\nGraduation: May 2020"
